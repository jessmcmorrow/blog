        12/09/2019: john bercow...my one true love</br>
        rip daniel johnston</br></br></br>
        14/09/2019: today I had band practise with sephi and rob. we practised t<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fvH9D4B148">h</a>e<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk_wUT1CvWM">s</a>e songs.
        waldo was sitting on the couch playing games on his phone. after practise i walked to paesano with sephi and</br>
        got pizza. me and mum went to the cinema to see the souvenir, which i thought wasn't very good honestly.</br>
        </br></br>15/09/2019: today i had work. i had a vegan chicken wrap for lunch and lydia and kimberley came in to see me.</br>
        i finished at half 4 and went to their flat to hang out while lydia waited to sell a ps4.</br>
        they'd been at some tempeh making workshop. the tempeh smelt good but tasted crap</br></br></br>
        16/09/2019: tonight that weird courgette, earlier mac n cheese, last night a potato rosti and edamame, the night before pizza, </br>
        the night before a falafel, the night before mousaka, night before weird onion bread with parsley on top, </br>
        night before cottage pie, night before burger, night before beetroot n hummus flatbread</br></br></br>
        17/09/2019: woke up. went to swg3, had a brownie for breakfast and when i tried to get out of the lift someone had locked</br>
        the door in front of it. couldn't stop laughing. when someone found me they started to laugh too. stayed up late last night reading</br>
        jade sharma's <i>problems</i>. "teach prostitutes to code, slap qr codes on homeless people"<br/><br/><br/>
        18/09/2019: read lovelock's <i>novascene</i>. almost finished it. andrew says his politics is dodgy but i think his takes on science are interesting enough for<br/>
        me to overlook that, especially since they aren't mentioned in the book. went to see <i>for sama</i>. cried three times. felt very sad for everyone who died<br/>
        in rebel held aleppo.
