            <p>Pleasure Seeks Charlotte’s Effects (1975). been lonely in berlin but not ALONE. just everything is shut and my mind is racing, i can't keep
                busy enough to feel tired at night. last week i did a ceramic class, throwing on the wheel, and it was so frustrating, it was like i was realising
                all my frustrations with life in real time, as this wheel spun round and round with a lump of clay on it that i couldn't control. today i met lydia and david
                and walked for four or five miles around the city, from neukolln to warschaurstrasse where david stays. we all felt low but not low enough to cry,
                just done in, just moaning. we got to his flat and admired his new uniqlo trousers, which i'm gonna get cal for christmas. yesterday rachel and sean came over 
                and we sat and lay on the couch under a duvet in the candle light and ate babaganoush. i've been sleeping so bad i think i see bugs everywhere; a throwback to having 
                cockroaches in summer. i got a job i start on jan 6 finally hopefully. with the money i'm gonna earn i could afford to figure out who i actually wanna be. i could 
                get a dog, swimming lessons, driving lessons, an expensive outfit hair and make up, attract a suitor, go to japan, buy some friends, buy a life. 
            </p>
            <p>miss my mom dad and brother. miss my microphone too. today me and lydia went running in tempelhof in the pissing rain.
                went back to her's and had a hot shower ate bulgur wheat n sausages n homemade beans then met edgar for coffee and a taco.
                we tried to go to the cinema but there were no seats next to each other so just went home. last night me and lydia got drunk
                on vodka n pink grapefruit fizzy juice n watched bombshell. i walked home at midnight. my face cream has gone missing today so i 
                asked my brother to send more. not sure if i lost it at the fleamarket at wedding or if it's been stolen :@. tomorrow i'm 
                going to see tom scholefield's deskless bedroom. me n sean are going to try n make a music video too. i have a job interview on tuesday
            </p>
            <p> i feel so sick and nervous . i have to do a numeracy test later and my flat mate turned off the wifi (no mate 
                about this !) so i'm sitting in the library. it's really warm i need to take my thermals off :-( just went to take my thermals
                off and the toilet is shut for rennovation for the full month so i had to go to a cabin outside and i forgot to lock the door 
                because i was so confused by the blue light and the darkness of the space and then someone walked in on me getting changed and looked
                really angry :-(
            </p>
            <p>i'm in berlin and it's my 27th birthday. at war with my flat mate who won't let me use the heating or the wifi.
                spent yesterday at the turkish market with rachel sean and lydia, then back to lydia's for a kale recipe by anna jones (lyd says kale is very hard 
                to come by in berlin). david gave me a backy home on his bike and i kept thinking my right foot was going to get caught in a car and i'd
                get pulled off and ran over and i have no health insurance (i thought i did because i took out travel insurance but i think
                if the flight is one way it doesn't work). the day before i walked all over kreuzberg and then the wrong way around tempelhof and then north to brandenburg tor 
                to meet rach n sean, via the topography of terror. it was too disgusting and i had to leave after i read half the boards.
                we made dinner using ingredients from the turkish shop and fresh flat breads for a hole in the wall. sean made maria's pesto recipe.
                i know no german all i can say is one soya cappucino please and then thanks when i'm handed it. i don't even like cappucinos that much
            </p>
            <p>today 29/09/2020 i met peter for cof - (ahhhh my freezer is making a really annoying noise??) fe and walked around newlands park.
                i hadn't seen him since last september when he got back from portugal and he had a funny hair cut he'd styled himself.
                he had as a present for me the piece of butter wrapper i'd wrote on saying ' i came to see you wow ' and slid under his door about 2 years ago.
                it was still greasy. now i'm going to see laurie paul, only i'm very tired. so tired i'm worried i have lymes disease
            </p>
            <p>i'm moving to berlin in 16 days. this morning i went for bagels with my dad only they had no filled vegan bagels so i had to get a sourdough sandwich
            with cauliflower and sweet potato in; not sure how i felt about this. cal got a cinnamon bun. then i looked for a flat and job in berlin for two hours but
            was overcome by stress and fell asleep. i' m going to carolyn's to do some sewing now. yesterday me sephi duncan rob and kenny had a coffee morning in the park
            sitting at the band stand like marlow's crew in season 4 of the wire</p>
            List of people i WANT to see before I leave:
            Joan, James, Claire, <s>Val</s>, Ria, <s>Laurie Paul</s>, mini (is this possible?), <s>Peter</s>, <s>Ruaidhri</s>, sally and reini, matty black, kimblerley! <br/><br/>

            did you know that in the 1600s people wore the lice they’d picked off you in lockets as a sign of affection? Last night me Ali and Lauren went to see
            tenet in the cinema. We smoked Ali's vape and drank pimms and then laughed loads at wtf was going on in the silly script. During the day I went running
            with Jessica around Queen's Park and up her old street where her family home was. she had latin class in the evening. today pamp studio sat on a zoom call
            about scottish coops and networking in Scotland. It's wednesday. On monday we went out for my dad's 49th bday and i DRANK some skinny coladas.<br>
            <p>All day I’ve lay in bed, it feels less like a day and more like a moment. It goes on and on and on. I search for jobs, apply for a job, exit the window of a job specification, get up, shower, eat snacks, lay down, fall asleep, wake up with a bunch of texts causing my phone to vibrate. I google ‘jobs portugal’, ‘jobs mexico’, ‘jobs berlin’. I don’t go anywhere. This has been going on for weeks. My friend texts saying she hates her job and that she’s quitting. If this is the alternative I would stay - never applying for a job because you know how bad they are. </p>
            <p>I get up, i go to the shop. I look at aspirational food accounts on instagram for half an hour before I do so - i don’t recognise half the words involved in the food description. Still i think i could be a chef, it’d be nice to stand on your feet all day. The energy would come up through the ground, travel up the spine, connect with the receptors in your brain. Your back would hurt though, bending over to empty and refill the dishwasher. You would have to get something for that, a wife or drugs. Now I’m in the shop and I pick up tomatoes and olive bread and bagels for Amy. I think ‘I’m going to bump into Meg or Mini’ only I can’t remember Meg’s name, just her face. Then I walk to the end of the aisle and hear a noise, a little big voice saying “hello”. Mini’s standing in front of me in a face mask and a greencity jumper. I’m so excited to see him; it’s been five months. He’s buying cigarettes. 
                When I get home the rain is so bad, the sky’s changed colour, it’s dark and it looks like it’s going to stay dark all day and maybe not stop raining until tomorrow. My dad is coming over at midday to walk to Syrian Pie with me, so we can have a lunch of dips and breads and pies and rice. The little woman who leans out of her window smoking cigarettes a block down from me is awake and smoking already. When she leans out of her window her nose must be getting wet. The air must be cold and fresh and clash with the smell of the cigarette, the atmosphere of her room. After a minute or two she slides the window down. 
            </p>
            12/08/2020: today i started an application form for camden council that I didn't finish, but I finished Severance, which I started on Monday
        Me aliyah jamie Carolyn Nadia and stew went for gnocchi for dinner and a drunk woman shouted slurs at us on the way home. stew cycled carolyn's bike along my road. I'm looking
        at a photograph Jack uploaded of himself at Beachy Head. Here's nadia and jamie's clothing <a href="https://www.sinesproject.com/">project</a> ☺<br/><br/>
        <small>From “The Burrow,” Franz Kafka (trans. Michael Hofmann)</small>//<br/>
        Bawdsey Manor, the site where radar was invented, just opposite the locations in Old Felixstowe that inspired key scenes in M R James's story "Oh, Whistle and I'll Come To You". The conversation will be illustrated by readings, a screening of Fisher and Sharp’s short film, Bleak and Solemn (2013) and excerpts from On Vanishing Land.
        <br><br>
        11/08/2020: went to ria's old house in ruchill. It was a home for the doctors who worked at Ruchill Hospital before
        they closed it in the 90s (demolished it in 2012). reading Severance by Ling Ma, Kimberley lent me her copy. she also gifted me some
        homemade kimchi and spicy carrot salad her mum made. Her mum said she doesn't like vegan food because it's what you eat when you're poor. Lydia gave me an ice cream 
        maker to make vegan ice cream. I want to try doing strawberry shortcake<br/><br/>
        04/08/2020: hmmm been studying software engineering all day. what is coupling??? <br/>yesterday i went to seb's studio and picked some wild flowers. they're 
        living in a passata jar in my kitchen window<br/><br/>
        30/07/2020: back from paris. i've included some photos from my holiday for you to look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrsZYpeOIVTNA9PVytO9WM0etilX__7EYG1Rx7mn1XU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a><br/><br/>
        24/07/2020: getting ready to go to paris <img src='photos/eiffelEmoji.jpg' width='35' height='35'><br /><br />
        23/07/2020: me and rob applied for a grant and i was too drunk when i uploaded the application and missed 9 sections :(<br/><br/>
        15/07/2020: living through covid has been boring</br>
        lost my job... lost my mind. only kidding. i've been reading lots of leonard michaels and watching mad men. in my head it's 1963 
        and i'm scared of the bay of pigs. Stories should be natural as apples, brief as lust, long as a thought. </br></br><br/>
        12/09/2019: john bercow...my one true love</br>
        rip daniel johnston</br></br></br>
        14/09/2019: today I had band practise with sephi and rob. we practised t<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fvH9D4B148">h</a>e<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk_wUT1CvWM">s</a>e songs.
        waldo was sitting on the couch playing games on his phone. after practise i walked to paesano with sephi and</br>
        got pizza. me and mum went to the cinema to see the souvenir, which i thought wasn't very good honestly.</br>
        </br></br>15/09/2019: today i had work. i had a vegan chicken wrap for lunch and lydia and kimberley came in to see me.</br>
        i finished at half 4 and went to their flat to hang out while lydia waited to sell a ps4.</br>
        they'd been at some tempeh making workshop. the tempeh smelt good but tasted crap</br></br></br>
        16/09/2019: tonight that weird courgette, earlier mac n cheese, last night a potato rosti and edamame, the night before pizza, </br>
        the night before a falafel, the night before mousaka, night before weird onion bread with parsley on top, </br>
        night before cottage pie, night before burger, night before beetroot n hummus flatbread</br></br></br>
        17/09/2019: woke up. went to swg3, had a brownie for breakfast and when i tried to get out of the lift someone had locked</br>
        the door in front of it. couldn't stop laughing. when someone found me they started to laugh too. stayed up late last night reading</br>
        jade sharma's <i>problems</i>. "teach prostitutes to code, slap qr codes on homeless people"<br/><br/><br/>
        18/09/2019: read lovelock's <i>novascene</i>. almost finished it. andrew says his politics is dodgy but i think his takes on science are interesting enough for<br/>
        me to overlook that, especially since they aren't mentioned in the book. went to see <i>for sama</i>. cried three times. felt very sad for everyone who died<br/>
        in rebel held aleppo.
        <br/>
        I thought I was spelling ‘pescetarianism’ wrong today but apparently Microsoft just prefers a different spelling to the one accepted by Google. I woke up this morning and ate cheese (vegan) grilled on toast with sliced onion. At work I drank an iced oat latte and for lunch I had a burrito with scrambled tofu. I didn’t have any dinner… instead I sat on the grass outside and read this interview with Julian Casablancas written back in 2003. He really talks about nothing, like actually nothing, the whole time. He just mumbles shit to Rolling Stone for an entire week, obviously drunk and high. At points getting close to being philosophical but always missing the mark. The only thing he’s saying that makes sense is how much he hates Pringles, like he hates these pop chips, doesn’t seem to matter what flavour. The interviewer is kind of like ‘okay, I get it, right, no Pringles’, trying to ask him about Nigel Godrich’s production or whatever. He keeps going back to the Pringles, like three different days in a row. On the last day they’re in 2A (on Avenue A, duh) and he’s just talking shit and then he leaves, ditching a half-eaten grilled cheese with extra bacon. Beside the sandwich debris, he leaves a folded up piece of paper. Probably looking for clues since the interviews have yielded so little, the Rolling Stones writer (Neil Strauss) unfolds it. It’s a receipt - for a tube of Pringles, purchased that day. <br/><br/>

         <p>A Vegan poem I wrote:
            Small children play 
In the park near my house.
They throw rocks at each other
They hunt out a mouse.
But the mouse that they find
Is actually a rat.
It's huge and it's hungry,
It's as big as a cat!</p>

<p>They try to dehunt the rat
But they cannot escape,
"This was all meant to be fun!
A bit of a jape!",
Is what one podgy child shouts,
with a mouth full of fear.
He pictures the rat gnawing 
On his cheek and his ear.
Will his mum still love him
If the rat chews him in half?
Or will she drown poor Peter,
Perhaps in the bath.</p>

<p>His friend is called Meg,
And she's terrified too. 
She once got bit by a rat
In a small petting zoo. 
She hazards a guess 
It could happen once more,
So she legs it all
The way to her front door.</p>

<p>But what Peter and Meg
Both fail to address,
Is they regularly eat rat,
And not under duress. 
They eat it in wraps, 
And in nugget form -
It's in every pack lunch,
That appears in the dorm. 
They stupidly assume that all meat is meat,
When sometimes it's rat
Or sometimes it's feet.</p>

<p>So next time you're out playing, 
Try to catch a rat, 
Because they're full of good protein
And the meat is low fat.</p><br/>

        <a href="">So I find it worrisome that suddenly the trans-exclusionary radical feminist position is understood as commonly accepted or even mainstream. I think it is actually a fringe movement that is seeking to speak in the name of the mainstream, and that our responsibility is to refuse to let that happen. </a><br/>
