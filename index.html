        23/07/2020: me and rob applied for a grant and i was too drunk when i uploaded the application and missed 9 sections :(<br/><br/>
        15/07/2020: living through covid has been boring</br>
        lost my job... lost my mind. only kidding. i've been reading lots of leonard michaels and watching mad men. in my head it's 1963 
        and i'm scared of the bay of pigs. Stories should be natural as apples, brief as lust, long as a thought. </br></br><br/>
        12/09/2019: john bercow...my one true love</br>
        rip daniel johnston</br></br></br>
        14/09/2019: today I had band practise with sephi and rob. we practised t<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fvH9D4B148">h</a>e<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk_wUT1CvWM">s</a>e songs.
        waldo was sitting on the couch playing games on his phone. after practise i walked to paesano with sephi and</br>
        got pizza. me and mum went to the cinema to see the souvenir, which i thought wasn't very good honestly.</br>
        </br></br>15/09/2019: today i had work. i had a vegan chicken wrap for lunch and lydia and kimberley came in to see me.</br>
        i finished at half 4 and went to their flat to hang out while lydia waited to sell a ps4.</br>
        they'd been at some tempeh making workshop. the tempeh smelt good but tasted crap</br></br></br>
        16/09/2019: tonight that weird courgette, earlier mac n cheese, last night a potato rosti and edamame, the night before pizza, </br>
        the night before a falafel, the night before mousaka, night before weird onion bread with parsley on top, </br>
        night before cottage pie, night before burger, night before beetroot n hummus flatbread</br></br></br>
        17/09/2019: woke up. went to swg3, had a brownie for breakfast and when i tried to get out of the lift someone had locked</br>
        the door in front of it. couldn't stop laughing. when someone found me they started to laugh too. stayed up late last night reading</br>
        jade sharma's <i>problems</i>. "teach prostitutes to code, slap qr codes on homeless people"<br/><br/><br/>
        18/09/2019: read lovelock's <i>novascene</i>. almost finished it. andrew says his politics is dodgy but i think his takes on science are interesting enough for<br/>
        me to overlook that, especially since they aren't mentioned in the book. went to see <i>for sama</i>. cried three times. felt very sad for everyone who died<br/>
        in rebel held aleppo.

        <div> A Vegan poem I wrote:
            Small children play 
In the park near my house.
They throw rocks at each other
They hunt out a mouse.
But the mouse that they find
Is actually a rat.
It’s huge and its hungry,
It’s as big as a cat!

They try to dehunt the rat
But they cannot escape,
“This was all meant to be fun!
A bit of a jape!”,
Is what one podgy child shouts,
with a mouth full of fear.
He pictures the rat gnawing 
On his cheek and his ear.
Will his mum still love him
If the rat chews him in half?
Or will she drown poor Peter,
Perhaps in the bath.

His friend is called Meg,
And she’s terrified too. 
She once got bit by a rat
In a small petting zoo. 
She hazards a guess 
It could happen once more,
So she legs it all
The way to her front door.

But what Peter and Meg
Both fail to address,
Is they regularly eat rat,
And not under duress! 
They eat it in wraps, 
And in nugget form -
It’s in every pack lunch,
That appears in the dorm. 
They stupidly assume that all meat is meat,
When sometimes it's rat
Or sometimes it's feet.

So next time you’re out playing, 
Try and catch a rat, 
Because they're full of good protein
And the meat is low fat.
