    THE GLORY OF PARADISE the translucent veil (1753)<br />
    the release from deception, modesty, blister the size of a jellyfish on my big toe<br /><br />

    how should a person be? a garden of creatures...<br />

    if i really got rid of everything i don't like i would have nothing<br /><br />

    conversation sparks joy in me<br />

    boredom is a cover for a more intense feeling, a fear of rejection?<br />
    produce love by loving,, "i am loved because i love" versus "i love because i am loved"<br />
    motherly love is by its very nature unconditional.... continuation of infantile love tendences ino adolescence and beyond, even much of adulthood<br />
    give people the space they need to dream<br />
    i love because i need you, versus i need you because i love you.<br /><br />

    as adults the longing for motherly love is hard to fulfil and often finds expression in religious forms. father represents the world of thought "since his love is conditioned,<br />
    i can do something to acquire it; his love is not outside of my control"<br /><br />

    have faith in life! this means, not being over anxious. a mature person comes to the point where they are their own mother/father, they become free from the mother and father<br />
    conscience outside of themselves but build these figures up inside instead.<br />

    love is relationship to the world, not to one person. people incorrectly think that it is an indication of the strength of their love that they love nothing but the person,<br />
    'constituted by the object... not the faculty' love is an activity, a power of the soul. love is an attitude which is the same towards all objects, myself included:)<br />
    is selfishness identical to self love? or is not causd by the very lack of it?<br />
    there is no concept of man in which i am myself am not included, thereby.. love for oneself cannot be separated from love/respect/understanding for another individual. if he can<br />
    love only others he cannot love at all.......<br /><br />

    erotic love is exclusive and cannot be universal..<br />
    no more barriers to overcome! no more sudden closeness to achieve.. this is when artificial love can collapse. the loved one becomes as well known (or should we say little? ;))<br />
    known, as oneself. 'miracle of overcoming the barriers and addiction to transforming the stranger into an intimate person'. the illusion that the new love will be different from<br />
    the earlier ones.<br/><br />

    if i truly love one person, i love all persons, i love the world, i love life, i love in you everybody<br />
    brotherly love has a lack of exclusiveness<br />
    penetrate from periphery to core, simone weil,<br /><br />

    LOVE IS A CATASTROPHE, IT'S A CRAZY ILLNESS. LOVE RUINS YOUR LIFE. BUT, I AM VERY SAD WHEN I AM NOT IN LOVE...zizeky<br /><br />

    butterflies == frail children of the air (kiss)<br />
    a woman with no drivers license is the closest we can get to a real life angel:) c'est moi<br /><br />

    i am becoming that which i am becoming:) think truth, live love and justice.. there is no meaning to life except the meaning we give it<br />
    both of us are the bow and the lyre<br />

    thought is only a more subtle horizon of ignorance<br />
    opposition is a category of man's mind, not in itself an element of reality<br />

    GOD -> ultimate reality..<br/>
    reality -> contradictions<br />
    no positive statement can be made of god<br />

    our relationship is nothing and thus it is like God<br />

    the absolute nothing - God, meister eckhart<br />
    a knowledge not in right thought but in right action<br />
    speak of God only in a poetic, symbolic sense<br />

    idolatrous love - if someone does not have a sense of identity rooted in the productive unfolding of their own powers he will idolise the loved one<br /><br />

    SUMMUM BONUM - bearer of all love, <br />
    the problem of existence can be solved by each one only for himself..<br /><br />

    everything has its time, dont force things<br /><br />

    conflicts in most people are actually attempts to avoid the real conflict. by their very nature, these small conflicts do not lend themselves to clarification nor solution<br />
    "Love is possible only if two persons communicate with each other from the centre of their existence!" - they are one with each other by being one with themselves<br />

    SUCCESS ON THE PERSONALITY MARKETttttt<br /><br />

    modern man thinks he loses something (time) when he does not do things quickly,-- yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains, --except kill it<br /><br />

    discipline is not a rule from the outside but an expression of one's own will.. alert equilibrium<br />
    all of us are more or less insane, or more or less asleep..<br /><br />

    the social implications of psychoanalytic revisionism - herbert marcuse 1955<br />
    simone weil - "only a martyr and a mad person can love in the world today"<br /><br />

    Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence<br />
