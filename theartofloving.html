    THE GLORY OF PARADISE the translucent veil (1753)<br />
    the release from deception, modesty, blister the size of a jellyfish on my big toe<br /><br />

    how should a person be? a garden of creatures...<br />

    if i really got rid of everything i don't like i would have nothing<br /><br />

    conversation sparks joy in me<br />

    boredom is a cover for a more intense feeling, a fear of rejection?<br />
    produce love by loving,, "i am loved because i love" versus "i love because i am loved"<br />
    motherly love is by its very nature unconditional.... continuation of infantile love tendences ino adolescence and beyond, even much of adulthood<br />
    give people the space they need to dream<br />
    i love because i need you, versus i need you because i love you.<br /><br />

    as adults the longing for motherly love is hard to fulfil and often finds expression in religious forms. father represents the world of thought "since his love is conditioned,<br />
    i can do something to acquire it; his love is not outside of my control"<br /><br />

    have faith in life! this means, not being over anxious. a mature person comes to the point where they are their own mother/father, they become free from the mother and father<br />
    conscience outside of themselves but build these figures up inside instead.<br />

    love is relationship to the world, not to one person. people incorrectly think that it is an indication of the strength of their love that they love nothing but the person,<br />
    'constituted by the object... not the faculty' love is an activity, a power of the soul. love is an attitude which is the same towards all objects, myself included:)<br />
    is selfishness identical to self love? or is not causd by the very lack of it?<br />
    there is no concept of man in which i am myself am not included, thereby.. love for oneself cannot be separated from love/respect/understanding for another individual. if he can<br />
    love only others he cannot love at all.......<br /><br />

    erotic love is exclusive and cannot be universal..<br />
    no more barriers to overcome! no more sudden closeness to achieve.. this is when artificial love can collapse. the loved one becomes as well known (or should we say little? ;))<br />
    known, as oneself. 'miracle of overcoming the barriers and addiction to transforming the stranger into an intimate person'. the illusion that the new love will be different from<br />
    the earlier ones.<br /><br />

    if i truly love one person, i love all persons, i love the world, i love life, i love in you everybody<br />
    brotherly love has a lack of exclusiveness<br />
    penetrate from periphery to core, simone weil,<br /><br />

    LOVE IS A CATASTROPHE, IT'S A CRAZY ILLNESS. LOVE RUINS YOUR LIFE. BUT, I AM VERY SAD WHEN I AM NOT IN LOVE...zizeky<br /><br />

    butterflies == frail children of the air (kiss)<br />
    a woman with no drivers license is the closest we can get to a real life angel:) c'est moi<br /><br />

    i am becoming that which i am becoming:) think truth, live love and justice.. there is no meaning to life except the meaning we give it<br />
    both of us are the bow and the lyre<br />

    thought is only a more subtle horizon of ignorance<br />
    opposition is a category of man's mind, not in itself an element of reality<br />

    GOD -> ultimate reality..<br />
    reality -> contradictions<br />
    no positive statement can be made of god<br />

    our relationship is nothing and thus it is like God<br />

    the absolute nothing - God, meister eckhart<br />
    a knowledge not in right thought but in right action<br />
    speak of God only in a poetic, symbolic sense<br />

    idolatrous love - if someone does not have a sense of identity rooted in the productive unfolding of their own powers he will idolise the loved one<br /><br />

    SUMMUM BONUM - bearer of all love, <br />
    the problem of existence can be solved by each one only for himself..<br /><br />

    everything has its time, dont force things<br /><br />

    conflicts in most people are actually attempts to avoid the real conflict. by their very nature, these small conflicts do not lend themselves to clarification nor solution<br />
    "Love is possible only if two persons communicate with each other from the centre of their existence!" - they are one with each other by being one with themselves<br />

    SUCCESS ON THE PERSONALITY MARKETttttt<br /><br />

    modern man thinks he loses something (time) when he does not do things quickly,-- yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains, --except kill it<br /><br />

    discipline is not a rule from the outside but an expression of one's own will.. alert equilibrium<br />
    all of us are more or less insane, or more or less asleep..<br /><br />

    the social implications of psychoanalytic revisionism - herbert marcuse 1955<br />
    simone weil - "only a martyr and a mad person can love in the world today"<br /><br />

    Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence<br />

    i am out for a bargain.. the object should be desirable from the standpoint of its social value, and at the same time should want me. two persons thus fall in love when they feel
    they have found the best object available on the market, considering the limitations of their own exchange value -> in a culture in which material success is the outstanding value, 
    there is little reason to be surprised that human love relations follow the same pattern of exchange which governs the commodity and labour market<br />
    are you falling in love... are you Standing in love?<br /><br />

    the two persons become well acquinted, their intimacy loses more its miraculous character... until their antagonisms kill whatever is left of the initial excitement:(<br />
    in the beginning they take the intensity of their infatuation as proof of the intensity of their love, while it may only be proof of their preceding loneliness<br /><br />

    love only profits the soul<br /><br />
    paradise...a state of original oneness with nature, once blocked from paradise man can only move forward by finding a new harmony. prehuman harmony was irretrievably lost.<br />
    man is life being aware of itself<br />
    there is no good or evil until there is freedom to disobey. after man and woman have become aware of themselves and of each other, they are aware of their separateness, adam blames eve,<br />
    this equates to human separation without union or REunion by love, is the source of shame and guilt and anxiety in humankind<br />
    how to achieve union.... the history of religion and philosophy is the culmination of the answers to this question:) <br /><br />
    It seems that after orgiastic exoerience man can go on for a time withu suffering too much from this separateness, anxiety comes from separateness, is overcome by performance of the ritual (orgiastic)<br /><br />
    
    alcoholism + drugs are forms chosen in non orgiastic culture but individuals feel more separate after this experience is over and thus are drive to take recourse with it in greater frequencey<br />
    ..the sexual act without love never bridges the gap between two human beings except momentarily..(what is a moment? is a moment a forever?)<br /><br />
    
    conformity! the group we conform to.. its growing larger.. with cultural developments and the internet.. previously based on blood and soul<br />
   
    equality meant we are all God's children, you know.. we all share in the same human divine substance.. we are all one. it also means/meant differences between individuals must be respected
    <br />.. cus while it's true we are all one, each of us is a unique entity, <u>a cosmos by itself</u><br />
    equality today however looks like sameness rather than oneness.<br />
    the soul has no sex == enlightenment philosophy<br />
    the longing for love and the dread of the nothing.. in creative work the creator unites himself with his material, which represents the world outside, worker and object become one,
    <br />man unites himself with the world in the process of creation. in modern work processes there is little left of this uniting process, and the individual ceases to be... s/hee<br /><br />
    without love humanity could not exist for a day<br /><br />

    masochism is used to escape the the isolation man feels, we make ourselves a part of the other and thereby lose our intergrity, the masochistic person is no longer fully born<br /><br />

    mature love is union under the condition of preserving one's individuality, integrity. love is an active power in man, one that permits him to be himself. or herself. whatever self<br />
    in love the paradox occurs that two beings become one yet remain two<br />
    a man sitting quiet and contemplating is considered 'passive'. in reality, this attitude of concentrated meditation is the highest activity there is, an activity of the soul, which is possible<br />
    only under the condition of freedom and independence<br /><br />

    spinoza's statement that virtue and power are one and the same. from Ethics.<br />
    love is an action, the practise of human power, which can be practised only in freedom and never as the result of compulsion.<br /><br />
    
    giving is the highest expression of potency. in the very act of giving i experience my strength, my wealth, my power. giving is more joyous than receiving, not cuz it is a deprivation<br />
    but because in the act of giving lies the expression of my ALIVEness:). note: the culmination of the male sexual function lies in the act of giving; the man gives himself, his sexual organ<br />
    to the woman. at the moment of orgasm he gives his semen to her<br /><br />

    giving implies to make the other person a giver also and they both share in the joy of what they have brought to life<br /><br />
    
    paint our love in pastel shades - THE PASTELS musical note emoji. iam alone in the night time, i wish you knew my mind, i am alone in my day dreams, i wish you dreamt it too<br />
    <br />
    the psychoanalyst is cured by the patient<br /><br />

    love is active concern for the life and the growth of that which we love. one loves that for which we labours, and labours for that which he loves. <br /><br />
    respect=the ability to see a person as they are, from respicere - to look at. to be aware of their unique individuality.. the coern that the other person should grow and unfold as s.he is, truly truly
